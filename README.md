Microservices with Spring Boot &amp; Spring Cloud With Live Example &amp; Source Code
n this session, we explore spring boot and spring cloud microservice architecture. I assume, you already have basic knowledge of RESTful API development. 

We would write & configure following spring cloud components :
1. Spring Cloud Config Server
2. Netflix Eureka Naming and Discovery server
3. Spring Cloud API Gateway Server
4. Netflix Ribbon Load Balancer
6. Zuul API Gateway Proxy
7. Open Feign Api to Api Communication
8. Zipkin Distributed Tracking with Sleuth and Rabbit MQ

To Demonstrate all the above component's functionality, we would write primarily our own microservices mentioned below:
1. Property Access Service
2. Product Stock Service 
3. Product Enquiry Service
